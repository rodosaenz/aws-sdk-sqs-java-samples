#AWS SQS Java Example

This sample demonstrates how to make basic requests to Amazon SQS using the AWS SDK for Java.

Prerequisites: You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be signed up to use Amazon SQS. For more information on Amazon SQS, see http://aws.amazon.com/sqs.

Fill in your AWS access credentials in the provided credentials file template, and be sure to move the file to the default location (~/.aws/credentials) where the sample code will load the credentials from.

WARNING: To avoid accidental leakage of your credentials, DO NOT keep the credentials file in your source directory.
